# üöó Insurance Risk Analysis & Pricing Optimization

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling an insurance dataset to uncover insights about risk, profitability, and pricing strategies. The analysis is structured into four key tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand data distributions, trends, and outliers.
2. **Data Versioning with DVC**: Ensure reproducibility and traceability of data pipelines.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistically test assumptions about risk drivers and customer segments.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict claim severity and optimize premiums using machine learning.

This work simulates an actuarial data science workflow for dynamic, risk-based pricing in the insurance industry.
